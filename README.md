# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Easter egg: 
```py 
import this
```

will print:

1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
2. Explicit is better than implicit.
3. Simple is better than complex.
4. Complex is better than complicated.
5. Flat is better than nested.
6. Sparse is better than dense.
7. Readability counts.
8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
9. Although practicality beats purity.
10. Errors should never pass silently.
11. Unless explicitly silenced.
12. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
13. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
14. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
15. Now is better than never.
16. Although never is often better than *right* now.
17. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
18. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
19. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

# The code examples
- Each "Zen Of Code" recommendation will be presented in the `zen_of_python` package.
- Each "Zen Of Code" recommendation is represented as a python module with it's own example collection.
- Some code examples are repeated in other example collections because they violate several "Zen Of Code" recommendations.
